Attributes:
    Class:
        Model(ci4_model_class, ci4_entity)

    Properties:
        Field(searchable)
        PrimaryKey()
        Derived() - denotes a field as an include or else it is counted as a normal field in the table. typically any field with the
        BelongsTo or HasMany attributes are denoted this way automatically. You can exlicitly use this if for some reason you have not
        used either of the two in a property thats not a field

        Relationships:
            BelongsTo(ci4_model/jengo_schema, from_field(fk) - the current class's field, selects(fields to select on derivation)) - one to one relationship
            HasMany(ci4_model/jengo_schema, from_field(fk), selects(fields to select on derivation)) - one to many relationship

So typically how this would work is someone can make the query request like so:
    Query::run(UserSchema::class, options: new QueryOptions(
        params: [
            'id' => 1
        ],
        page: 1,
        limit: 25,
        derive: ['profile'],
        singleEntry: true,
        mode: INLINE
    ));

    or // something similar to tempest

    query(UserSchema::class)
        ->inline() // inline mode
        ->where('id', 1) // where clause
        ->page(1)
        ->limit(25)
        ->derive('profile')
        ->first(); // single entry return

    Typically these two should offer the same result and it depends on which one you prefer.

In the config for a model in DBMap we had a computed fields section which you can use
the Computed(name: name of the field to be added with the result) attribute with a corresponding public method(named as you wish).

We have an issue with aliases which we can leave to be generated during runtime automatically by going though all the joins in the
request and mapping them approriately before exection.

In this package, we hold the ci4 models as the source of truth always for things information on the table we are making requests to,
 the only things that should be written explicityl are the foreign_key names i.e the table fields.
